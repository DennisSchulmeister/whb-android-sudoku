The wordlist has been created with the following commands
on my Fedora Linux installation:

git@github.com:tldr-pages/tldr.git
cd tldr/pages/commin
ls --color=never | grep "^[[:lower:]]\+.md$" > ../knownwords.txt
ls --color=never /sbin | grep "^[[:lower:]]\+.md$" >> ../knownwords.txt

Then removing the .md suffix from all commands in a text editor.
